2016-2018. Pet project. Main purpose - getting information from external resources within dialogs with other people in social network VK.

Was integrated with more than 20 APIs (VK API, Google, Twitter, translate services, computer vision, sentiment analysis, text-to-speech, media content, news, weather, web scrapping, etc.). 
At the moment of creation there were no similar products in VK.

Development stopped in 2018 due to new policy of VK network (bots in personal dialogs between people had been prohibited).

Technology - Python (requests, bs4, VK API, API libs).
